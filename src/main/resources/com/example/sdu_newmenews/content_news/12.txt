Title: Adidas backtracks on Black Lives Matter design opposition
Text: Adidas says it is withdrawing a request to the US Trademark Office to reject a Black Lives Matter (BLM) application for a trademark featuring three parallel stripes.

The sportwear giant did not give a reason for the reversal.

On Monday, Adidas said the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation design would create confusion with its own famous three-stripe mark.

It added that it has been using its logo for more than 70 years.

"Adidas will withdraw its opposition to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation's trademark application as soon as possible," a spokesperson for the German company said in a statement emailed to the BBC on Wednesday.

The company declined to make any further comment on the decision.

Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation is the most prominent entity in the decentralised BLM movement.

The group applied for a US trademark in November 2020 for a yellow three-stripe design to use on merchandise including clothing and bags.

In a notice of opposition submitted to the trademark office, Adidas said the proposed design "incorporates three stripes in a manner that is confusingly similar to the Three-Stripe Mark in appearance and overall commercial impression".

The company added that consumers who are familiar with its goods and services "are likely to assume" that those offered under the applicant's mark "originate from the same source, or that they are affiliated, connected, or associated with or sponsored by Adidas".

The US Patent and Trademark Office gave Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation until 6 May to respond to the challenge.

Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
