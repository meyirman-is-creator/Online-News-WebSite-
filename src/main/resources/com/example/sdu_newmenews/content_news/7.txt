Title: What is happening to house prices, and could there be a crash?
Text: House prices have fallen in recent months, as growing interest rates have made mortgages more expensive, and high inflation has reduced people's spending power.

But mortgage interest rates may be stabilising. How might this affect house prices?

What is happening to house prices around the UK?
Prices rose steeply - by about 25% - across most of the UK from the start of 2020 until Autumn 2022.

But they have fallen by about 4% from that peak according to February's figures from Nationwide.

Those recent changes build on very different patterns of growth over the last 15 years.

Northern Ireland's house prices have still have not returned to the levels seen before 2008 global financial crisis.

In contrast, London and the South East saw prices recover quickly up until 2015, then saw less growth during the race-for-space period of the pandemic, which saw many people relocate to cheaper areas.
