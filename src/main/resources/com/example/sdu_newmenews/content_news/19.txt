Title: Climate change: World's top court to weigh in
Text: The world's top court will for the first time advise on countries' legal obligations to fight climate change, following a UN resolution on Wednesday.

The International Court of Justice will now prepare an advisory opinion that could be cited in climate court cases.

The motion came from Vanuatu, a low-lying Pacific island nation facing peril from rising sea levels.

Vanuatu's Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau called it "a win for climate justice of epic proportions".

The motion, sponsored by more than 130 countries, was greeted with cheers.

The idea for the legal opinion was originally proposed by law students in Fiji four years ago.

It was then taken up by Vanuatu, a country with bitter experience of the impacts of rising temperatures.

Earlier this year it , at an estimated cost in damages of roughly half the country's annual GDP.

These experiences gave added weight to Vanuatu's UN resolution, seeking legal clarity on responsibilities for climate change.

The country emphasised that it is not seeking the court's opinion to put in place new restrictions but to clarify existing obligations to prevent harm to the environment.
